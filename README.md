# Arcade Remake
## Interaction Instructions
My interaction method is to use the keyboard to interact: use the W, S, A, and D keys to control Pac-Man to move up, down, left, and right. And make Pac-Man walk along the maze path and then "eat" all four ghosts. When all ghosts are eaten, a message "Mission Success!" will pop up. And you can press the r key to restart a new game.
## Details
### Difference
The point is, unlike the traditional Pac-Man gameplay, where they need to eat rectangular pixels in the channel and avoid ghosts to get points, our gameplay is to "eat" the ghosts.

### Animation
In this project, I animated Pacman's position, the ghost's state, and the game over state. 
#### Technical Implementation
Pacman's animation is implemented by changing its direction through keyboard input. The movement updates its coordinates according to the current direction, and a new position is drawn each frame to create the illusion of animation. 

Ghosts are initialized at random path positions, each with an `alive` state set to `true`. When Pacman gets close to a ghost, the `checkEatGhosts()` function detects the collision based on distance and sets the ghostâ€™s `alive` status to `false`. 

The game ends when all ghosts are eaten, and the `gameOver` flag becomes `true`. This state is checked in the `draw()` loop, which then displays a success message overlay.

Pacman's movement is constrained to a series of predefined maze paths. Coordinate checks are performed to ensure that Pacman remains on a valid path before updating its position.
##### Collision Detection
This technology is used to determine whether Pac-Man has eaten a ghost, so that the player wins when all ghosts are eaten. In `draw()`, `dist(pacman.x, pacman.y, ghost.x, ghost.y)` is called to calculate the distance between Pac-Man and each ghost. If the distance is less than a certain threshold,such as 16 pixels, it means a collision has occurred. Once a collision occurs, the ghost's state is set to alive = false, and it will no longer be drawn.

##### Path Constraint
We hope that Pac-Man can only move on the channel we set, rather than through the background or the shell of the body. It is also the key to restore the classic gameplay - Pac-Man can only take the route of "white dots". And in this way, the player will have a sense of direction when controlling. 

First, we set all feasible paths to a set of line segments, that is, `{x1, y1, x2, y2}` in the path array paths. Whenever the player presses the arrow key, the program will try to update Pac-Man's coordinates, but will not update directly. 

It is necessary to detect whether the line segment is horizontal or vertical(`path.y1 === path.y2`). If it is horizontal, first check whether Pac-Man's Y axis is close to the path Y axis(`Math.abs(screenY - p.y1) < 15`), and then check whether Pac-Man's X axis is within the start and end X axis range(`screenX >= Math.min(p.x1, p.x2) - 15 && screenX <= Math.max(p.x1, p.x2) + 15`). If the conditions are met, the position is actually updated. Only on the path is it allowed to continue moving.

`Math.abs() `is used to calculate the numerical distance between Pac-Man and the path, ensuring the result is always positive regardless of direction. This allows the program to check whether Pac-Man is close enough to a valid path from either side.
