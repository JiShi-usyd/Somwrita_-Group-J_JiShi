# Arcade Remake
## Interaction Instructions
My interaction method is to use the keyboard to interact: use the W, S, A, and D keys to control Pac-Man to move up, down, left, and right. And make Pac-Man walk along the maze path and then "eat" all four ghosts. When all ghosts are eaten, a message "Mission Success!" will pop up. And you can press the r key to restart a new game.

### Difference
The point is, unlike the traditional Pac-Man gameplay, where they need to eat rectangular pixels in the channel and avoid ghosts to get points, our gameplay is to "eat" the ghosts.

### Animation
In this project, I animated Pacman's position, the ghost's state, and the game over state. 
#### Technical Implementation
Pacman's animation is implemented by changing its direction through keyboard input. The movement updates its coordinates according to the current direction, and a new position is drawn each frame to create the illusion of animation. 

Ghosts are initialized at random path positions, each with an `alive` state set to `true`. When Pacman gets close to a ghost, the `checkEatGhosts()` function detects the collision based on distance and sets the ghostâ€™s `alive` status to `false`. 

The game ends when all ghosts are eaten, and the `gameOver` flag becomes `true`. This state is checked in the `draw()` loop, which then displays a success message overlay.

Pacman's movement is constrained to a series of predefined maze paths. Coordinate checks are performed to ensure that Pacman remains on a valid path before updating its position.
##### Collision Detection
This technology is used to determine whether Pac-Man has eaten a ghost, so that the player wins when all ghosts are eaten. In `draw()`, `dist(pacman.x, pacman.y, ghost.x, ghost.y)` is called to calculate the distance between Pac-Man and each ghost. If the distance is less than a certain threshold,such as 16 pixels, it means a collision has occurred. Once a collision occurs, the ghost's state is set to alive = false, and it will no longer be drawn.
